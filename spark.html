			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				The Spark project was inspired by a game called ARC (Attack Retrieve Capture) that didn't survive a series of corporate mergers.
				Since the rights to the artwork and sounds were not released Spark used all new original graphics/sound and was coded from scratch in Java.
				This was my first project that was cross-platform and correctly runs on Windows/Linux/Mac OSX.
			</p>
			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<p>
				The main goal in Spark is simply to capture the flag and defend your own.  In order to do this you are armed with primary lasers and 3 special
				weapons. The first special weapon is a Missile. Many players combine a missile shot with a laser which will instantly kill a target if you hit
				them. The second special weapon is a grenade. It explodes and does splash damage around the map. The third weapon is called a bouncy. It's a
				laser shot that bounces off the walls until it hits somebody. Bouncies are difficult to master but expert players are very good with them.
			</p>
			<h3>Current Status</h3>
			<p>
				The Spark project was sold to a group of community members who are running the game under the name "Armor Critical".

			</p>
			<p>
				As long as this project exists I have agreed not to compete with it or release any code.  If the project is retired I will either bring back
				Spark or find a new leader to run the project.
