# CodeMallet-Site

This is the main site for codemallet.com that contains information about all the game projects I have done over the years.

The site was written originally as a school project and was only allowed to contain HTML5, CSS3, and some supporting vanilla javascript (no libraries permitted, only vanilla javascript).

The site automatically resizes to display correctly on any device such as tablets/phones/etc.
